Hi everyone, I'm Alex from Investomation and today I'm going to talk about decentralized finance, DeFi for short.

# DeFi: The Hidden Wealth Generator

It's been said that when the gold rush of California happened, more money was made by the stores selling shovels than by the gold miners themselves. We often look for quick speculative gains while ignoring stable returns right under our noses, deeming them less sexy. I'm seeing the same pattern in DeFi.

A lot of hype is generated by traders about finding the next Matic or Solana before it pumps. A lot of fear about short-term direction of markets. Are we going to see another correction next week or a 5X pump? What if I told you that in the grand scheme it won't really matter.

No, I'm not talking about HODLing, I'm talking about participating in the ecosystem. If you're going to hold that sexy Solana token, you might as well put it to use.

In traditional centralized banking system, we have banks controlling the flow of our money. This is because want a guarantee that our money won't disappear tomorrow. The beauty of crypto is democratization of the banking system. I can run a bank you'll trust without having to trust me personally. The rules are in the code, visible to everyone.

This is what we call decentralized finance. The beauty of crypto isn't its growth in price, the growth is a side-effect of a growing ecosystem. You stand to gain more by participating within the ecosystem than speculating on its growth. It's the difference between buying Google stock and being one of Google's early employees.

Best way to think about cryptocurrencies is like Legos. They build upon each other and their final value is directly proportional to the number of use cases. The more intertwined your crypto of choice is in the ecosystem, the more popular it will be. The more popular it will be, the higher the appreciation.

There are several approaches to winning the adoption contest:

- First comer advantage (Yahoo, MySpace, Ethereum)
- Better by design (Google, Facebook, Cardano, Solana, Harmony)
- Strategic partnerships (Oracle, Elrond, VeChain)
- Popularity/Hype (Dogecoin, SafeMoon)

Speculator's mindset is to win, to find that Ethereum killer. But if you're participating within the ecosystem, you don't care who wins. If you pick your ecosystem correctly, so that it's at least in the top 50 somewhere eventually, you'll make more money within the ecosystem than either the HODLers or the speculators. By participating within the ecosystem, you become the guy supplying newcomers with coins within, and of course you collect a small fee. These small fees over time will make you wealthy as the ecosystem grows.

Let's look at an example. One of my favorite coins is Harmony. The problem is its price has plateaued for a few months now. There are a lot of innovations in its ecosystem but it doesn't have Elon Musk tweeting about it so the masses don't care about it. As a holder of this coin, you could do one of 3 things:

1. Sell it, and buy something that's trending, a strategy that's disastrous for your long-term investing because you'll always end up buying high and selling low this way.

2. HODL it until its price eventually rises, a great strategy if you indeed did your homework correctly and are holding a coin that's greatly undervalued. This is the value investing strategy Warrent Buffet advocated. The problem with this strategy is two-fold:

  - First is that it's incredibly hard to practice the discipline needed to keep calm when everyone else claims the sky is falling, watching your coins go to 20% of the price you paid for them is nerve-wrecking, even if the fundamentals say that it's a winner. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, as they say.
  - The second problem with this approach is that you only learn the information that's readily available in news articles and white papers. 
  - (insert a whole lot of new writing that trello lost)
  -  there is still a risk that you glazed over some problem with the platform while doing your research, like the fact that the fees are too high for everyday use, or that it doesn't yet have smart contract capability, or
